        "text": "Moore's Law, created in 1965 by Gordon Moore, is based on the idea that the amount of transistors in a computer would double every two years. Shockingly, this rule has remained as a golden rule in technological innovation for the last 50 years, as our computational progress has roughly remained on this track."

        "text": "This suggestion that our progress will become significantly faster, smaller, and more efficient over time, has become widely regarded as one of the hallmark theories of the 20th and 21st centuries, and it carries important implications for the future of technological innovation â€” both for our progress and our limitations."
